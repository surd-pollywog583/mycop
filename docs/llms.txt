# mycop

> mycop is an open-source AI code security scanner (SAST) built in Rust. It detects and auto-fixes vulnerabilities in AI-generated Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript code using 100 built-in security rules covering OWASP Top 10 and CWE Top 25 categories.

mycop uses pattern matching and AST analysis via tree-sitter to find security issues like SQL injection, XSS, command injection, hardcoded secrets, insecure cryptography, and more. It supports AI-powered auto-fix with Claude, GPT-4, Ollama, and other providers. Output formats include colored terminal, JSON, and SARIF for CI/IDE integration. It integrates with GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, and VS Code. No AI API key is required for scanning — AI is optional and used only for auto-fix and explanation features.

## MCP Server (Agentic Tool Integration)
- mycop includes a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, started via `mycop mcp`
- Enables Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and other agentic tools to call mycop's scanning and review capabilities directly
- 5 tools: scan, list_rules, explain_finding, review, check_deps (fix is CLI-only — agents apply fixes themselves using scan fix_hints)
- 2 resources: mycop://rules/catalog (JSON), mycop://config/schema (YAML)
- Communicates over STDIO using JSON-RPC 2.0
